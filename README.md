# Doctor Fee Prediction

# Project Overview 
- In today's healthcare landscape, data-driven approaches are pivotal for 
enhancing patient outcomes and addressing industry challenges. Leveraging 
comprehensive datasets, this project endeavors to employ machine learning 
techniques to analyze various attributes related to medical services. By 
developing predictive models for regression and classification tasks, we aim to 
gain insights into factors influencing medical service fees while accurately 
predicting fee categories. Through this effort, we aim to optimize healthcare 
services, fostering better decision-making and ultimately improving patient 
care.
# Problem Statement 
- The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning 
techniques to enhance the healthcare landscape by predicting 
medical service fees and catering to different audiences' needs.
This project is structured into two milestones :
	**1.** (Milestone 1) Regression Task: Predicting Fee Prices -
Developing a regression model to estimate the fee prices for 
medical services based the dataset attributes.
	**2.** (Milestone 2) Classification Task: Predicting Fee Categories -
Categorizing Fee Prices into categories and building a classification 
model to predict medical service belong to which category (e.g., 
expensive, cheap, affordable)
