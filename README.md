# Doctor Fee Prediction

# Project Overview 
- In today's healthcare landscape, data-driven approaches are pivotal for 
enhancing patient outcomes and addressing industry challenges. Leveraging 
comprehensive datasets, this project endeavors to employ machine learning 
techniques to analyze various attributes related to medical services. By 
developing predictive models for regression and classification tasks, we aim to 
gain insights into factors influencing medical service fees while accurately 
predicting fee categories. Through this effort, we aim to optimize healthcare 
services, fostering better decision-making and ultimately improving patient 
care.
# Problem Statement 
- The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning 
techniques to enhance the healthcare landscape by predicting 
medical service fees and catering to different audiences' needs.
This project is structured into two milestones :

	**1.** (Milestone 1) Regression Task: Predicting Fee Prices -
Developing a regression model to estimate the fee prices for 
medical services based the dataset attributes.

	**2.** (Milestone 2) Classification Task: Predicting Fee Categories -
Categorizing Fee Prices into categories and building a classification 
model to predict medical service belong to which category (e.g., 
expensive, cheap, affordable)

# Project Pipeline:
   **1.** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a deep analysis of the dataset to 
understand the distribution and relationships between the features.Observe and 
handle any errors within the features.Explore the distribution of fee prices and 
identify potential correlations with other features.

   **2.** Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and any 
inconsistencies in the dataset. Perform data cleaning and normalization 
to ensure the quality and consistency of the data.

   **3.** Feature Encoding: Encode categorical variables into numerical 
representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. Utilize 
techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding to transform 
categorical attributes into a format understandable by regression 
models.

   **4.** Feature Selection: Identify and select relevant features that contribute 
most to predicting fee prices.Using techniques such as correlation 
analysis or feature importance ranking.

   **5.** Model Building: Experimenting with multiple regression and classification algorithms 
through extensive model selection, tuning, and evaluation processes to 
identify the best-performing model.

   **6.** Model Selection: After tuning and evaluating the models, selecting the 
best-performing regression and classification models based on its performance on the 
dataset. Subsequently, training the chosen models and assessing its 
performance on test data to analyze and gain insights from the results
